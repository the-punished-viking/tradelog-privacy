  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 2025</p>
  <p>
    TradeLog (“the App”) is developed and operated by <strong>TradeLogic Studios</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”).
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the TradeLog mobile application.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>
    TradeLog helps users record diary entries, create invoices, log mileage, and store receipts.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to transparency regarding how your data is handled.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>A. Data You Create</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Invoices, diary entries, mileage logs, and notes</strong> — stored only on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Receipt photos and exported files (PDF/CSV)</strong> — generated and saved locally on your device.
        These are never automatically transmitted to us or any third party.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>B. Data Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> — collects anonymized app usage data (screen views, interactions, performance metrics).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> — collects crash logs and diagnostic data to help us identify and fix technical issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> — displays ads and may use the <em>Advertising ID</em> to provide, measure, and personalize ad content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent any personal information.
    The following third parties may process limited, anonymized data on our behalf:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Analytics & Crashlytics)</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (Advertising)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These services collect data in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All locally stored data (invoices, photos, diary entries) remains on your device’s storage.</li>
    <li>Data transmitted to Google (for analytics, crash reports, ads) is encrypted in transit using HTTPS (TLS).</li>
    <li>We do not maintain personal accounts or cloud backups, so uninstalling the app will permanently remove your local data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Advertising and Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    TradeLog uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display ads.
    AdMob may use cookies and device identifiers to serve and measure personalized or non-personalized ads.
    Users in regions covered by the EU/EEA, UK, or California privacy laws may receive a consent prompt allowing them to opt out of personalized advertising.
  </p>

  <h2>6. GDPR (European Union & United Kingdom)</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, you have specific rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The right to access, correct, or delete your personal data.</li>
    <li>The right to restrict or object to processing.</li>
    <li>The right to data portability.</li>
    <li>The right to withdraw consent for personalized advertising at any time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Since TradeLog does not maintain user accounts or store personal data on its own servers, most data control remains on your device.
    For data processed by Google (Analytics or AdMob), please review Google’s GDPR resource center:
    <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance/" target="_blank">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/compliance/</a>.

    <li>Request information about what data is collected or shared.</li>
    <li>Request deletion of personal information collected by service providers such as Google.</li>
    <li>Opt out of the sale or use of personal data for targeted advertising.</li>
  </ul>
